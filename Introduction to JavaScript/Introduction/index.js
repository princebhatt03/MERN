// Introduction to JavaScript

// JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. It is a versatile language that can be used for both front-end and back-end development. JavaScript is an essential part of web development, along with HTML and CSS.
// It is an interpreted language, which means that it is executed line by line by the browser. This allows for dynamic and interactive web pages, as JavaScript can respond to user actions in real-time.

console.log('Hello, World!'); // This is a simple JavaScript program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
// JavaScript can be used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which is a representation of the structure of a web page. This allows you to change the content and style of a web page dynamically.
// JavaScript can also be used to make network requests, allowing you to fetch data from a server and update the web page without reloading it. This is commonly done using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) or Fetch API.

// NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, enabling you to build scalable and high-performance web applications. Node.js is event-driven and non-blocking, making it suitable for I/O-intensive tasks such as handling multiple requests simultaneously.
